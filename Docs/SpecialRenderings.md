### Special tag renderings 



In a tagrendering, some special values are substituted by an advanced UI-element. This allows advanced features and visualizations to be reused by custom themes or even to query third-party API's.

General usage is `{func_name()}`, `{func_name(arg, someotherarg)}` or `{func_name(args):cssStyle}`. Note that you _do not_ need to use quotes around your arguments, the comma is enough to separate them. This also implies you cannot use a comma in your args

### wikipedia 

 A box showing the corresponding wikipedia article - based on the wikidata tag 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
keyToShowWikipediaFor | wikidata | Use the wikidata entry from this key to show the wikipedia article for
 
#### Example usage 

 `{wikipedia()}` is a basic example, `{wikipedia(name:etymology:wikidata)}` to show the wikipedia page of whom the feature was named after. Also remember that these can be styled, e.g. `{wikipedia():max-height: 10rem}` to limit the height


### minimap 

 A small map showing the selected feature. 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
zoomlevel | 18 | The (maximum) zoomlevel: the target zoomlevel after fitting the entire feature. The minimap will fit the entire feature, then zoom out to this zoom level. The higher, the more zoomed in with 1 being the entire world and 19 being really close
idKey | id | (Matches all resting arguments) This argument should be the key of a property of the feature. The corresponding value is interpreted as either the id or the a list of ID's. The features with these ID's will be shown on this minimap.
 
#### Example usage 

 `{minimap()}`, `{minimap(17, id, _list_of_embedded_feature_ids_calculated_by_calculated_tag):height:10rem; border: 2px solid black}`


### sided_minimap 

 A small map showing _only one side_ the selected feature. *This features requires to have linerenderings with offset* as only linerenderings with a postive or negative offset will be shown. Note: in most cases, this map will be automatically introduced

### import_button 

 This button will copy the data from an external dataset into OpenStreetMap. It is only functional in official themes but can be tested in unofficial themes.

#### Importing a dataset into OpenStreetMap: requirements

If you want to import a dataset, make sure that:

1. The dataset to import has a suitable license
2. The community has been informed of the import
3. All other requirements of the [import guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) have been followed

There are also some technicalities in your theme to keep in mind:

1. The new feature will be added and will flow through the program as any other new point as if it came from OSM.
    This means that there should be a layer which will match the new tags and which will display it.
2. The original feature from your geojson layer will gain the tag '_imported=yes'.
    This should be used to change the appearance or even to hide it (eg by changing the icon size to zero)
3. There should be a way for the theme to detect previously imported points, even after reloading.
    A reference number to the original dataset is an excellent way to do this
4. When importing ways, the theme creator is also responsible of avoiding overlapping ways. 
    
#### Disabled in unofficial themes

The import button can be tested in an unofficial theme by adding `test=true` or `backend=osm-test` as [URL-paramter](URL_Parameters.md). 
The import button will show up then. If in testmode, you can read the changeset-XML directly in the web console.
In the case that MapComplete is pointed to the testing grounds, the edit will be made on https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org


#### Specifying which tags to copy or add

The first argument of the import button takes a `;`-seperated list of tags to add.

These can either be a tag to add, such as `amenity=fast_food` or can use a substitution, e.g. `addr:housenumber=$number`. 
This new point will then have the tags `amenity=fast_food` and `addr:housenumber` with the value that was saved in `number` in the original feature. 

If a value to substitute is undefined, empty string will be used instead.

This supports multiple values, e.g. `ref=$source:geometry:type/$source:geometry:ref`

Remark that the syntax is slightly different then expected; it uses '$' to note a value to copy, followed by a name (matched with `[a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`). Sadly, delimiting with `{}` as these already mark the boundaries of the special rendering...

Note that these values can be prepare with javascript in the theme by using a [calculatedTag](calculatedTags.md#calculating-tags-with-javascript)
 
  
 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
tags | _undefined_ | The tags to add onto the new object - see specification above
text | Import this data into OpenStreetMap | The text to show on the button
icon | ./assets/svg/addSmall.svg | A nice icon to show in the button
minzoom | 18 | How far the contributor must zoom in before being able to import the point
 
#### Example usage 

 `{import_button(,Import this data into OpenStreetMap,./assets/svg/addSmall.svg,18)}`


### multi_apply 

 A button to apply the tagging of this object onto a list of other features. This is an advanced feature for which you'll need calculatedTags 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
feature_ids | _undefined_ | A JSOn-serialized list of IDs of features to apply the tagging on
keys | _undefined_ | One key (or multiple keys, seperated by ';') of the attribute that should be copied onto the other features.
text | _undefined_ | The text to show on the button
autoapply | _undefined_ | A boolean indicating wether this tagging should be applied automatically if the relevant tags on this object are changed. A visual element indicating the multi_apply is still shown
overwrite | _undefined_ | If set to 'true', the tags on the other objects will always be overwritten. The default behaviour will be to only change the tags on other objects if they are either undefined or had the same value before the change
 
#### Example usage 

 {multi_apply(_features_with_the_same_name_within_100m, name:etymology:wikidata;name:etymology, Apply etymology information on all nearby objects with the same name)}


### tag_apply 

 Shows a big button; clicking this button will apply certain tags onto the feature.

The first argument takes a specification of which tags to add.
These can either be a tag to add, such as `amenity=fast_food` or can use a substitution, e.g. `addr:housenumber=$number`. 
This new point will then have the tags `amenity=fast_food` and `addr:housenumber` with the value that was saved in `number` in the original feature. 

If a value to substitute is undefined, empty string will be used instead.

This supports multiple values, e.g. `ref=$source:geometry:type/$source:geometry:ref`

Remark that the syntax is slightly different then expected; it uses '$' to note a value to copy, followed by a name (matched with `[a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`). Sadly, delimiting with `{}` as these already mark the boundaries of the special rendering...

Note that these values can be prepare with javascript in the theme by using a [calculatedTag](calculatedTags.md#calculating-tags-with-javascript)
  

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
tags_to_apply | _undefined_ | A specification of the tags to apply
message | _undefined_ | The text to show to the contributor
image | _undefined_ | An image to show to the contributor on the button
id_of_object_to_apply_this_one | _undefined_ | If specified, applies the the tags onto _another_ object. The id will be read from properties[id_of_object_to_apply_this_one] of the selected object. The tags are still calculated based on the tags of the _selected_ element
 
#### Example usage 

 `{tag_apply(survey_date:=$_now:date, Surveyed today!)}` Generated from UI/SpecialVisualisations.ts
