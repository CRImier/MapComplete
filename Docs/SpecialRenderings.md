### Special tag renderings 

 In a tagrendering, some special values are substituted by an advanced UI-element. This allows advanced features and visualizations to be reused by custom themes or even to query third-party API's. General usage is `{func_name()}`, `{func_name(arg, someotherarg)}` or `{func_name(args):cssStyle}`. Note that you _do not_fcs need to use quotes around your arguments, the comma is enough to separate them. This also implies you cannot use a comma in your args 
### all_tags 

 Prints all key-value pairs of the object - used for debugging 
#### Example usage 

 `{all_tags()}` 
### image_carousel 

 Creates an image carousel for the given sources. An attempt will be made to guess what source is used. Supported: Wikidata identifiers, Wikipedia pages, Wikimedia categories, IMGUR (with attribution, direct links) 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
image key/prefix (multiple values allowed if comma-seperated) | image | The keys given to the images, e.g. if <span class='literal-code'>image</span> is given, the first picture URL will be added as <span class='literal-code'>image</span>, the second as <span class='literal-code'>image:0</span>, the third as <span class='literal-code'>image:1</span>, etc... 
 
#### Example usage 

 `{image_carousel(image)}` 
### image_upload 

 Creates a button where a user can upload an image to IMGUR 

name | default | description

### wikipedia 

 A box showing the corresponding wikipedia article - based on the wikidata tag 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
keyToShowWikipediaFor | wikidata | Use the wikidata entry from this key to show the wikipedia article for
 
#### Example usage 

 `{wikipedia()}` is a basic example, `{wikipedia(name:etymology:wikidata)}` to show the wikipedia page of whom the feature was named after. Also remember that these can be styled, e.g. `{wikipedia():max-height: 10rem}` to limit the height 
### minimap 

 A small map showing the selected feature. Note that no styling is applied, wrap this in a div 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
zoomlevel | 18 | The (maximum) zoomlevel: the target zoomlevel after fitting the entire feature. The minimap will fit the entire feature, then zoom out to this zoom level. The higher, the more zoomed in with 1 being the entire world and 19 being really close
idKey | id | (Matches all resting arguments) This argument should be the key of a property of the feature. The corresponding value is interpreted as either the id or the a list of ID's. The features with these ID's will be shown on this minimap.
 
#### Example usage 

 `{minimap()}`, `{minimap(17, id, _list_of_embedded_feature_ids_calculated_by_calculated_tag):height:10rem; border: 2px solid black}` 
### reviews 

 Adds an overview of the mangrove-reviews of this object. Mangrove.Reviews needs - in order to identify the reviewed object - a coordinate and a name. By default, the name of the object is given, but this can be overwritten

subjectKey | name | The key to use to determine the subject. If specified, the subject will be <b>tags[subjectKey]</b>

------ | --------- | -------------
key | opening_hours | The tagkey from which the table is constructed.
 
#### Example usage 

 `{opening_hours_table(opening_hours)}` 
### live 

 Downloads a JSON from the given URL, e.g. '{live(example.org/data.json, shorthand:x.y.z, other:a.b.c, shorthand)}' will download the given file, will create an object {shorthand: json[x][y][z], other: json[a][b][c] out of it and will return 'other' or 'json[a][b][c]. This is made to use in combination with tags, e.g. {live({url}, {url:format}, needed_value)} 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
Url | undefined | The URL to load
Shorthands | undefined | A list of shorthands, of the format 'shorthandname:path.path.path'. separated by ;

### histogram

key | undefined | The key to be read and to generate a histogram from
title |  | The text to put above the given values column
countHeader |  | The text to put above the counts
colors* | undefined | (Matches all resting arguments - optional) Matches a regex onto a color value, e.g. `3[a-zA-Z+-]*:#33cc33`
 
#### Example usage 

 `{histogram('some_key')}` with properties being `{some_key: ['a','b','a','c']} to create a histogram 
### share_link 

 Creates a link that (attempts to) open the native 'share'-screen 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
url | undefined | The url to share (default: current URL)

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
key | undefined | The key of the tag to give the canonical text for
 
#### Example usage 

 {canonical(length)} will give 42 metre (in french) 
### import_button 

 This button will copy the data from an external dataset into OpenStreetMap. It is only functional in official themes but can be tested in unofficial themes.

If you want to import a dataset, make sure that:

1. The dataset to import has a suitable license
2. The community has been informed of the import
3. All other requirements of the [import guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) have been followed

There are also some technicalities in your theme to keep in mind:

1. The new point will be added and will flow through the program as any other new point as if it came from OSM.
    This means that there should be a layer which will match the new tags and which will display it.
2. The original point from your geojson layer will gain the tag '_imported=yes'.
    This should be used to change the appearance or even to hide it (eg by changing the icon size to zero)
3. There should be a way for the theme to detect previously imported points, even after reloading.
    A reference number to the original dataset is an excellen way to do this    
 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
tags | undefined | Tags to copy-specification. This contains one or more pairs (seperated by a `;`), e.g. `amenity=fast_food; addr:housenumber=$number`. This new point will then have the tags `amenity=fast_food` and `addr:housenumber` with the value that was saved in `number` in the original feature. (Hint: prepare these values, e.g. with calculatedTags)
text | Import this data into OpenStreetMap | The text to show on the button
icon | ./assets/svg/addSmall.svg | A nice icon to show in the button
minzoom | 18 | How far the contributor must zoom in before being able to import the point
 
#### Example usage 

 `{import_button(,Import this data into OpenStreetMap,./assets/svg/addSmall.svg,18)}` 
### multi_apply 

 A button to apply the tagging of this object onto a list of other features. This is an advanced feature for which you'll need calculatedTags 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
feature_ids | undefined | A JSOn-serialized list of IDs of features to apply the tagging on
keys | undefined | One key (or multiple keys, seperated by ';') of the attribute that should be copied onto the other features.
text | undefined | The text to show on the button
autoapply | undefined | A boolean indicating wether this tagging should be applied automatically if the relevant tags on this object are changed. A visual element indicating the multi_apply is still shown
overwrite | undefined | If set to 'true', the tags on the other objects will always be overwritten. The default behaviour will be to only change the tags on other objects if they are either undefined or had the same value before the change
 
#### Example usage 

 {multi_apply(_features_with_the_same_name_within_100m, name:etymology:wikidata;name:etymology, Apply etymology information on all nearby objects with the same name)} Generated from UI/SpecialVisualisations.ts
